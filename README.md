# Maratron-scripts
Disclaimer: I know nothing about Python. AI(mostly Gemini) helped me make this work.

My version of Maratron scripts: walk, run, sprint, and look side while advancing(steamvr required)

original Ideas thanks to Clasted Bheeks on Youtube, and r/MaratronCreatorsClub.

# Brief explanation:

Features
1. Walk, run, and sprint. Character will also do the same thing according to your speed.
2. Look side whild advancing forward(body direction)
3. You must change the speed in the script if the default one doesn't match your walking stride.

ex) Skyrim

UEVR version is not complete yet, but almost working in some games.


# Why just not use Rewasd or interceptor(explain later)?

anti-cheat matter. Also I want to look side while advancing forward(body direction)(Does Rewasd already have this feature? let me know pls.)

# Requriements and Installing

1. Maratron (mouse based) <br>
original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI1uRLpOi9g&t=3s  <br>
my version: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcz-0sI4GwNBTiLZFkxNrg_vheGL-_U9J

2. Installing Python <br>
I don't know about Python, so I just followed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MaratronCreatorsClub/comments/1o8m4dd/how_to_run_a_python_script_for_fer_slers/  <br>
, but somehow I run the script differently. I will explain in How-to section.

3. Installing RawAccel (eliminates the X movement of a specific mouse(one on the Maratron)) <br>
It could be bannable, but people say it's safe. Install in here: https://github.com/RawAccelOfficial/rawaccel

# How-to

## mouse preparation <br>
run Rawaccel<br>

<img width="2086" height="1173" alt="rawaccel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba4e12f1-6071-4a9d-b756-417ee3b714bd" />

test if your maratron mouse only goes up and down.
<br>

## Running the script <br>
BE CAREFUL: when you run the script, your mouse will be locked and won't move on the flat screen. So, MEMORIZE the red letters in the image.<br>
TO be short: when you want your mouse back(=stopping the script), ALT + TAB, tab, tab, to find the script window, then, Ctrl + C, and Ctrl + D. closed. done. <br>

for more changes, just put this in Gemini and it will explain everything.


# Future plan
UEVR version(currently the system is working in .lua)(I will share the scripts when it's done) <br>
A skyrim mod that can also control the sprint speed, which makes maratron also control the sprint speed. <br>
etc.
