# Maratron-scripts
Disclaimer: I know nothing about Python. AI helped me make this work.

My version of Maratron scripts: walk, run, sprint, and look side while advancing(steamvr required)

original Ideas thanks to Clasted Bheeks on Youtube, and r/MaratronCreatorsClub.

1. Walk, run, and sprint. Character will also do the same thing according to your speed.
2. Look side whild advancing forward(body direction)

UEVR version is not complete yet, but almost working in some games.


# Why just not use Rewasd or interceptor(explain later)?

anti-cheat matter. Also I want to look side while advancing forward(body direction)(Does Rewasd already have this feature? let me know pls.)

# Requriements and Installing

1. Maratron (mouse based)
original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI1uRLpOi9g&t=3s
my version: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcz-0sI4GwNBTiLZFkxNrg_vheGL-_U9J

2. Installing Python
I don't know about Python, so I just followed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MaratronCreatorsClub/comments/1o8m4dd/how_to_run_a_python_script_for_fer_slers/
, but somehow I run the script differently. I will explain in How-to section.

3. Installing RawAccel (eliminates the X movement of a specific mouse(one on the Maratron))
It could be bannable, but people say it's safe. Install in here: https://github.com/RawAccelOfficial/rawaccel

# How-to

-mouse preparation
run Rawaccel

test if your maratron mouse only goes up and down.
